I am a **[Post-Doctoral Research Associate](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/kothakonda-manish-kumar/)** at Northeastern University working with Qing Zhao at **[Computational Catalyst Design group](https://www.qzhao-neu.com/)** since Sept 2023. Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at Tulane University, New Orleans at **[Jianwei Sun's](https://www.matcomp.org/) Materials computation group** and Postdoctoral Research associate at the National Renewable Energy Lab & Colorado School of Mines.

As a **materials scientist**, I work closely with experimentalists, leveraging **computation and machine learning** to elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of **catalytic active materials**. My research focuses on understanding and designing sustainable materials critically needed for heterogeneous catalysis and environmental applications.

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging
> I am committed to creating environments that are inclusive, equitable, and welcoming to everyone-whether personally or professionally. My approach is grounded in kindness, open-mindedness, and empathy.
>
> 1. Kindness: I believe in open, respectful communication. It’s important to me that different perspectives are welcomed, and I strive to treat others as I would want to be treated.
>
> 2. Open-mindedness: I focus on understanding rather than assuming. I’m aware of biases and am committed to actively reducing them. I also encourage those around me to uphold the same standards of inclusivity.
>
> 3. Empathy: I always keep in mind that we are working together to solve complex scientific and engineering challenges. I value patience and space for growth—both for myself and those I collaborate with.
>
These principles guide me in my work as a scientist and engineer, and I’m dedicated to fostering a positive and ethical environment for everyone.

## Research interests & contributions 
### I. Thermodynamic stability of solids using r^2SCAN density functional
> In this study, we assess the r2SCAN functional for its accuracy and stability in predicting solid-state thermodynamic properties, including formation and decomposition enthalpies, equilibrium volumes, and band gaps of over 1,000 solids. We compare r2SCAN with SCAN, PBE, and dispersion-corrected variants (SCAN+rVV10 and r2SCAN+rVV10). r2SCAN maintains accuracy comparable to SCAN, often improving upon SCAN for intermetallic systems, while balancing numerical stability. Notably, r2SCAN+rVV10 offers slightly better volume predictions but marginally less accurate formation enthalpies. Overall, r2SCAN is recommended as a reliable, general-purpose meta-GGA for materials discovery.
