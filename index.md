I am an **[Post-Doctoral Research Associate](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/kothakonda-manish-kumar/)** at Northeastern University working with the **[Computational Catalyst Design group](https://www.qzhao-neu.com/)** using the guidance of Dr. Qing Zhao since Sept 2023. Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at Tulane University, New Orleans at the **[Jianwei Sun's](https://www.matcomp.org/) Materials computation group** and Postdoctoral Research associate at National Renewable Energy Lab.

As a **materials scientist**, I work closely with experimentalists, leveraging **computation and machine learning** to elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of **catalytic active materials**. My research focuses on understanding and designing sustainable materials critically needed for heterogeneous catalysis and environmental applications.

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging
> I am committed to creating environments that are inclusive, equitable, and welcoming to everyone-whether personally or professionally. My approach is grounded in kindness, open-mindedness, and empathy.
>
> 1. Kindness: I believe in open, respectful communication. It’s important to me that different perspectives are welcomed, and I strive to treat others as I would want to be treated.
>
> 2. Open-mindedness: I focus on understanding rather than assuming. I’m aware of biases and am committed to actively reducing them. I also encourage those around me to uphold the same standards of inclusivity.
>
> 3. Empathy: I always keep in mind that we are working together to solve complex scientific and engineering challenges. I value patience and space for growth—both for myself and those I collaborate with.
>
These principles guide me in my work as a scientist and engineer, and I’m dedicated to fostering a positive and ethical environment for everyone.
