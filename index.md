I am an **[Post-Doctoral Research Associate](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/kothakonda-manish-kumar/)** at Northeastern University working with the **[Computational Catalyst Design group](https://www.qzhao-neu.com/)** using the guidance of Dr. Qing Zhao since Sept 2023. Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at Tulane University, New Orleans with the **[Jianwei Sun's](https://www.matcomp.org/)** and Postdoctoral Research associate at National Renewable Energy Lab.

As a **materials scientist working closely with experiments** using computation and machine learning, my research elucidates thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of atoms or molecules to understand and design urgently-needed, sustainable materials for **energy storage and the environment**.

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging 

> We are committed to fostering environments that are professionally and personally inclusive, equitable, psychologically safe, and **welcoming to all teammates**. We do this by leading with **kindness, open-mindedness, and empathy**.  
> 
> 1. **Kindness**: We communicate openly and respectfully, remembering that it is okay for others to have different opinions from us. We treat others with the kindness we want others to treat us. 
> 2. **Open-mindedness**: We leave assumptions behind, and seek first to understand. We are aware of community biases and are persistent in finding new ways to reduce them. Lastly we actively encourage our peers to hold themselves to these same standards. 
> 3. **Empathy**:  We always remember that we are on the same team, working together on science and engineering challenges that need our solutions. We give ourselves and others the time, space, and patience to grow and learn.
> 
> These are our guiding principles as **ethical scientists and engineers**.
